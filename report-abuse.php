                We are fighting against malware, phishing, botnets, and all the other
                forms of malicious attacks from the day of our establishment and have
                developed certain measures and technologies to help you protect and
                prevent against such kinds of threats as much as possible. In addition,
                we have also collaborated with some security companies, independent
                experts, law enforcement agencies to ensure stronger security against
                these threats.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though these kinds of threats are indispensable that’s why we have
                created a Report abuse form to get a solution as soon as possible.
